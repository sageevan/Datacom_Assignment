    * Available Scripts
      In the project directory, you can run:
         ### `npm start`
             Runs the app in the development mode.
             Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

         ### `npm test`
             Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

         ### `npm run build`
              Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
              It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
              The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
              Your app is ready to be deployed!

         ### `npm run eject`
              **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
              If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time.
              This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
     * npm run build and npm run start will take to the view in browser and APP is ready to use.
